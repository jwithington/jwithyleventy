<h2>It Has Been a Time</h2>
<main id="main-content"><p>Dear Readers,</p>
<p>It has been a time.</p>
<hr>
<p>I got to go the final XOXO. It felt like a found family reunion -- for me, and for many folks who had attended before this year. I got to see <a href="http://mikeeagle.net/">Open Mike Eagle</a> sing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn_or9gEB6g">&quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul</a> (&lt;--video link) at our very own karaoke. I saw both [Never Post][never] and Annie from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/depthsofwikipedia">Depths of Wikipedia</a> bring the house down during a glorious night of performances.</p>
<p>And I did that after battling COVID -- it didn't hit me all that hard, physically. Mentally? I was, of course, a wreck. I took my antivirals to hopefully ease the long term pain, and the doctor cleared me for the conference.</p>
<hr>
<p>I've also had some really exciting, promising interviews...and one pretty rough one. ðŸ˜‚ I've hit some lows a bit, again, but also bounced back. I've gotten <strong>incredibly excited</strong> about different web projects, <a href="https://syntax.fm/show/812/css-4-5-and-6-with-google-s-una-and-adam">heard about</a> (and hell yeah-ed about)<a href="https://nerdy.dev/text-box-ftw">new css</a> that's coming soon, and considered how to create my own <a href="https://cohost.org/rc/tagged/css%20crimes">css crimes</a>.
And I've also looked around and gone, &quot;wait, it's been almost two months since I was fired up and working on <a href="https://earnest-cactus-e2ee4c.netlify.app/">my new site using eleventy</a>?!?!?&quot;</p>

<p>Anyway, because most folks likely won't see this yet, here's a logo I built in CSS for a meetup that doesn't exist / I haven't started yet:</p>
<p class="codepen" data-height="600" data-slug-hash="ZEdjYOz" data-pen-title="tacoma-logo-rubik" data-user="jwithington" style="height: 600px; width:600px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

<p>It's a time of highs and lows, y'all. ðŸŽ¢</p>
