<p>I just submitted a talk for <a href="https://2024.squiggleconf.com/#call-for-speakers">SquiggleConf</a>, a conference about web dev tooling. In a way that, to me, feels very <em>like</em> me, it's not about electronic tools at all.</p>
<p>I submitted a conference about intuition as your best tool.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the luckiest, best decisions I made in 2020 was signing up for Jocelyn K. Glei's <a href="https://jkg.co/hifi">Hi-Fi</a> course, a course that, at that time, was something like 5 or 6 months long, running from (I believe) around April 2020 until September or so.</p>
<p>Those months were...interesting, if you recall.</p>
<hr>
<p>But the class? All about <em>intuition</em>.</p>
<p>About tapping into something deeper than the surface. Things lieke:</p>
<ul>
<li>intuitively picking images for a collage at the beginning of the course, not even knowing what the collage &quot;meant&quot; yet</li>
<li>meditation and breathing techniques</li>
<li>paying real attention to the &quot;inputs&quot; we take in (music, podcasts, news, etc.)</li>
<li>using tarot cards for insight</li>
</ul>
<p>It wasn't all woo-woo stuff, though I have to say, the woo-woo stuff really helped.</p>
<p>It left a mark on me, and when I'm struggling, it feels a bit like I've lost my way as far as my intuition.</p>
<p>So, for a conference like SquiggleConf that will likely have a lot to say about productivity tools, new AI stuff, and VS Code extensions, I of course thought, &quot;What if the best tool is your own gut feeling?&quot;</p>
<p>We'll see if the talk gets accepted -- but I'm pretty sure I'll be submitting it elsewhere, either way. ðŸ˜€</p>
