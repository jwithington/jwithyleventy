<h1>Working in Public</h1>
<p>I'm currently unemployed, and one thing that that means is <strong>time</strong>. I've got a lot of it.</p>
<p>And I'm also a front end developer that misses doing the fun-for-me parts of web development.</p>
<p>And I also just attended the wonderful <a href="https://cascadiajs.com/2024">CascadiaJS</a> conference, where my head got filled up with so much learning with so many fun people.</p>
<hr>
<p>For about a week now, I've had this itch. I want to blog again. I want to make it a semi-regular practice, something like what so many of my fellow <a href="https://home.omg.lol/">omg.lol</a> folks talk about when they link to <a href="https://bjhess.com/posts/you-re-a-blogger-not-an-essayist">Barry's post</a>. I remembered Chris Coyier <a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2022/06/27/there-is-no-bar/">wrote about this, too</a>.</p>
<p>At the conference, I also discovered something: my main jimwithington.com site's CSS was borked. Totally busted. And that makes sense, as it was a template site I built before I knew how to do anything, and then I hosted it on <a href="https://surge.sh/">surge.sh</a>, and then I always said to myself &quot;hmm, I should update that.&quot;</p>
<p>(This kind of thing happens! As a web dev you don't always want to do this stuff after work hours, too!)</p>
<p>I quickly made the domain point to <a href="https://jwithy.omg.lol/">my omg.lol profile</a>, which was a great stopgap measure.</p>
<p>And theeeennnnn I considered maybe doing a process where I set up a new blog with a new blog service, then eventually replace it with...whatever I come up with.</p>
<p>After a bunch of thinking, I realized some things:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have both website-from-scratch knowledge and stuff like, y'know, this here weblog space I hadn't really used.</li>
<li>I've been wanting to try <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">eleventy</a> for a long time.</li>
<li>Building something would both keep me from getting too rusty with my skills <em>and</em> hopefully provide me with talking points, stuff to show off, and new skills.</li>
<li>Instead of worrying that my new thing sucks, I could document the process, doing the &quot;work in public&quot; thing that I'm even more interested in after <a href="https://cascadiajs.com/2024/talks/putting-fun-back-into-coding">Jason's Cascadia Talk</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm especially excited about that last point, and feeling a lot of momentum around it. I'm a huge believer in using <a href="https://personalsit.es/">personal sites</a> as playgrounds to try out new things.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://cascadiajs.com/2024/talks/putting-fun-back-into-coding">Jason's talk</a> taught me that, hey, if you have stuff you love, and you do it in public, that's a really good way for folks to then <em>ask you to do that kinda work for them</em>.</p>
<p>So let's see how it goes!</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://earnest-cactus-e2ee4c.netlify.app/">in-progress version</a> of what I'm building. I can't wait to keep adding to it and making it real!</p>
