# About me

- I'm a software engineer / front-end web developer based in Lakewood, WA.
- I'm mostly going to use this blog to track my learning, but occasionally you'll see other things, too.
- I like building things with clean code and clean design
- I'm a huge fan of fountain pens, handwritten letters, [retro handhelds][retro], [Field Notes](http://fieldnotesbrand.com), live music, and getting excited about things. ðŸŽ‰
