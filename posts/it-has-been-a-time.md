Dear Readers,

It has been a time.

---

I got to go the final XOXO. It felt like a found family reunion -- for me, and for many folks who had attended before this year. I got to see [Open Mike Eagle][open] sing ["Birdhouse in Your Soul][birdhouse] (<--video link) at our very own karaoke. I saw both [Never Post][never] and Annie from [Depths of Wikipedia][depths] bring the house down during a glorious night of performances.

And I did that after battling COVID -- it didn't hit me all that hard, physically. Mentally? I was, of course, a wreck. I took my antivirals to hopefully ease the long term pain, and the doctor cleared me for the conference.

---

I've also had some really exciting, promising interviews...and one pretty rough one. ðŸ˜‚ I've hit some lows a bit, again, but also bounced back. I've gotten **incredibly excited** about different web projects, [heard about][syntax] (and hell yeah-ed about) [new css][css] that's coming soon, and considered how to create my own [css crimes][crimes].
And I've also looked around and gone, "wait, it's been almost two months since I was fired up and working on [my new site using eleventy][eleventy]?!?!?"

Anyway, because most folks likely won't see this yet, here's a logo I built in CSS for a meetup that doesn't exist / I haven't started yet:

<p class="codepen" data-height="600" data-slug-hash="ZEdjYOz" data-pen-title="tacoma-logo-rubik" data-user="jwithington" style="height: 600px; width:600px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/jwithington/pen/ZEdjYOz">
  tacoma-logo-rubik</a> by Jim Withington (<a href="https://codepen.io/jwithington">@jwithington</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>

It's a time of highs and lows, y'all. ðŸŽ¢
