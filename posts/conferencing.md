I just submitted a talk for [SquiggleConf](https://2024.squiggleconf.com/#call-for-speakers), a conference about web dev tooling. In a way that, to me, feels very _like_ me, it's not about electronic tools at all.

I submitted a talk about intuition as your best tool.

One of the luckiest, best decisions I made in 2020 was signing up for Jocelyn K. Glei's [Hi-Fi][hifi] course, a course that, at that time, was something like 5 or 6 months long, running from (I believe) around April 2020 until September or so.

Those months were...interesting, if you recall.

But the class? All about _intuition_.

About tapping into something deeper than the surface. Things lieke:

- intuitively picking images for a collage at the beginning of the course, not even knowing what the collage "meant" yet
- meditation and breathing techniques
- paying real attention to the "inputs" we take in (music, podcasts, news, etc.)
- using tarot cards for insight

It wasn't all woo-woo stuff, though I have to say, the woo-woo stuff really helped.

It left a mark on me, and when I'm struggling, it feels a bit like I've lost my way as far as my intuition.

So, for a conference like SquiggleConf that will likely have a lot to say about productivity tools, new AI stuff, and VS Code extensions, I of course thought, "What if the best tool is your own gut feeling?"

We'll see if the talk gets accepted -- but I'm pretty sure I'll be submitting it elsewhere, either way. ðŸ˜€
